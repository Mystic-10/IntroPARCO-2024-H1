# IntroPARCO-2024-H1

### Tools and Libraries
- **gcc** 9.1.0 version
- **omp.h** (and a compiler that supports OpenMP)

## Running the program with pbs file
To execute the project you need to have in the directory the two files present in this repository:
- deliverable1.pbs
- deliverable1.c
IMPORTANT: change the path within the file "deliverable1.pbs" by setting the correct one where these two files are located

To run "deliverable1.pbs", use the following command:
```bash
qsub deliverable1.pbs
```
Within this file there are several controls (in case of error displayed in the file "deliverable1.o"):
- "delivereble1.c" is not found in the same directory
- "delivereble1" is not created after compiling "deliverable1.c" due to errors reported in the "deliverable1.e" (created in the same directory by "deliverable1.pbs")

Also, within the "deliverable1.pbs" file, each time it is run, it is specified that the files "deliverable1_omp.csv" and "deliverable1_imp_seq.csv" created within the "deliverable1.c" are deleted being they in append for need.

## Running the program individually
Compile the file "deliverable1.c" with this command:

```bash
gcc -o deliverable1 deliverable1.c -fopenmp
```

This will create an executable named ```deliverable1```.
Now, you can use this command by replacing "size" with the size of the matrix:

```bash
./deliverable1 size
```

## Example of output 
Here is an example of the output generated by the program:
```bash
