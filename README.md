# IntroPARCO-2024-H1

### Tools and Libraries
- **gcc** 9.1.0 version
- **omp.h** (and a compiler that supports OpenMP)

## Running the program with ```deliverable1.pbs```
To reproduce the project you need to have in the same directory these two files that you can find in this repository:
- `deliverable1.pbs`
- `deliverable1.c`
  
IMPORTANT: change the path within the file ```deliverable1.pbs``` by setting the correct one where these two files are located

To run deliverable1.pbs, use the following command:
```bash
qsub deliverable1.pbs
```
Within this file there are several controls (in case of error will be displayed the motivation in the file ```deliverable1.o```):
- if ```delivereble1.c``` is not found in the same directory
- if ```delivereble1``` is not created after compiling ```deliverable1.c``` due to errors reported in the ```deliverable1.e```

Also, within the ```deliverable1.pbs``` file, it is specified that the files ```deliverable1_omp.csv``` and ```deliverable1_imp_seq.csv``` created on the ```deliverable1.c``` are deleted at each execution, being they in append for need.

To change the size of the matrix you can modify the first parameter of the following command within the file `delivereble1.pbs`:
```bash
./deliverable1 size     # Replace size
```

## Running the program individually
Compile the file ```deliverable1.c``` with this command:
```bash
gcc -o deliverable1 deliverable1.c -fopenmp -O2
```

This will create an executable named ```deliverable1```.
Now, you can use the following command by replacing ```size``` with the size of the matrix:
```bash
./deliverable1 size     # Replace size
```

## Example of output 
Here is an example of the output generated by the program:
```bash
